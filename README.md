pull-channel-yt
===============
This file will help you to get all the videos list from YouTube channels, this first attempt pull the video's id and title, and save them to an video.html file creating a list inside the html file.

I will try to complete it to have at the end one playlist that updates automatically with every new video on the YouTube channel
